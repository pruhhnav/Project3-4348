My Thoughts?
I am creating the project and laying the basic structure of the B-tree. There is nothing too problematic up to this point, but I want to make sure the constants and helper functions are properly set up for serialization.
Plan:
My plan is to create make constants for the SIZEOF_BLOCK and SPECIAL_NUM. I also want to create some helper functions for byte conversions to help with the overall serialization. On top of that, I am creating skeleton classes for BTreeNode, BTreeHeader, and IndexFile.
Reflection:
I set up the constants and helper functions and then implemented the base structure. This was not too bad. I am now going to add serialization and the deserialization logic end of things to the BTreeHeader and the BTreeNode.

What I know?
This B-tree project wants me to make a program with a menu to handle index files using B-tree structure.
Plan?
My plan is to first start on the create and open commands. I need to finish all these commands and make sure the file can be read properly but for now, 
I am going to work on these few commands.
