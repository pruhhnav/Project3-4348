This project makes a B-tree index file manager which allows user to make and manage different index files. 

**Current files:**
This repository contains two files - devlog.md and myprojcode.py. Devlog.md is used to show my progress and thinking throughout my progress of making this program. 
Myprojcode.py is the actual code file which ties all of the functionality together such as the B-tree components, command menu, and overall program flow.

**How to compile and run the program?**
In order to compile and run the program, python 3 must be installed on your system. Once it is installed, you must go to the terminal and navigate to the directory
which contains the myprojcode.py file. You can then run it on the terminal and access the program.

**Anything to tell the TA?**
There are comments in the code to help explain the functionality of it.
